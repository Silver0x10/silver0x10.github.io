# Hi!
This should be my personal page. \
The idea is to create a porfolio to frame the best projects I've worked on so far. 

# Setup
## Install THREE.js
```bash
npm install three
```
## Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
## Deploy on GitHub pages
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

# ToDOs

## general / home
- [X] fix blur effect on the borders [01.02.25]
- [ ] Optimize for Google search
- [ ] CV download
- [ ] Writing effect
- [ ] blog section (?)

## 3D scene
- [ ] make model loading faster
- [X] movement of the donut on scrolling [01.02.25]

## projects section:
- [ ] update with thesis work
- [ ] RL project link
- [ ] make more clear the separation between each project
- [ ] transition between home and project (fixed on one until a "powerfull" scroll happens)
- [X] make the ↑ arrow to go back home better looking and the same in all OSs [01.02.25]
